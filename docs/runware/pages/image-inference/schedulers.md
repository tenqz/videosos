## [What schedulers do](#what-schedulers-do)

Schedulers are algorithms that control the progression of the denoising process in generative models. When generating an image, the model starts with random noise and progressively refines this noise into a coherent image. The scheduler dictates how the noise reduction happens over each iteration, impacting the quality, speed, and style of the generated image.

Although the [scheduler](/docs/en/image-inference/api-reference#request-scheduler) parameter is optional (the model's own scheduler is used by default), you can specify a different scheduler from the following tables.
