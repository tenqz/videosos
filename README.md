## Roadmap

We're actively working on making VideoSOS even better! Here are the features and improvements we're planning:

### Timeline Enhancements
- **Segment Reordering** - Drag segments freely on the timeline to reorder them (currently they only bump into adjacent segments)
- **Click-to-Seek** - Click anywhere on the timeline to move the playhead cursor (currently only arrow keys work)
- **Volume Control** - Interactive volume adjustment with visual horizontal line controls for audio segments
- **Waveform Display** - Stretch audio waveforms to match full segment length on timeline

### Editing Features
- **Segment Duplication** - Ctrl+Drag to create copies of segments (standard video editor workflow)
- **Lip-sync Integration** - New Lip-sync tab with FAL lip-sync models (video + audio input)

### Generation Workflow
- **Persistent Sidebar** - Keep generation sidebar open after submission to queue multiple generations
- **Runware Status** - Show generation status in sidebar like FAL (currently locks until complete)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+Enter to submit generations
- **Advanced Parameters** - Expose additional model parameters (steps, resolution, guidance, etc.) where available

### Technical Improvements
- **Model Verification** - Verify and fix all models across all providers (some currently not working)
- **Server-side Rendering** - Optional server-side FFMPEG for faster video export (FFMPEG API integration)
